# Rishu Sharma's Website (Now Ported to React!)

[Visit My Website](https://rishitsharma.netlify.app/)  
[Visit My Old Website For Comparison](https://firebolt9907.github.io/)

## Why Port?

I felt like my old website had become hard to maintain and add features to, while my Flutter apps and python scripts were significantly easier to maintain. I researched a few solutions to this, and came to React. With backing from Facebook and a vast community, React was an easy choice. Additionally, Framer Motion support for vanilla JS was lackluster compared to that for React. 

## About This Project

This is a React port of my personal website, designed to showcase my projects. It is built using React and aims to provide a more satisfying experience compared to the previous version.
